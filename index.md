## About
This is a home for packaging various software into Debian and Ubuntu.  Most notable package under DEB.SURY.ORG is the PHP packaging.

## Who am I?

I am a Debian Developer since year 2000, and I have been packaging PHP for
Debian since PHP 5.  That means the official packages in Debian and Ubuntu are
either my work or they are based on my work.  The PHP packages in my Ubuntu PPA
and Debian DPA matches the official packages in Debian.  Basically I am saying
that you can't get any closer than that.

## News

I publish the most important changes in the packaging and interesting news in dedicated twitter feed:

## Packages

All packaging work is either done directly in the Debian unstable, or it will be in the unstable sooner or later.

### PHP Packages

The main repositories now contain both PHP 5.6 and PHP 7.0 coinstallable together.

#### Ubuntu PPA

* [ppa:ondrej/php](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php/) -- the main PHP repository

#### Debian DPA

* [packages.sury.org/php](https://packages.sury.org/php/) -- the main PHP repository for Debian

## Bug Reporting

DEB.SURY.ORG has now public lightweight [issue tracker](https://github.com/oerdnj/deb.sury.org/issues) at github.com. Please report any bugs or feature requests for ppa:ondrej/* there, since my INBOX is a not very reliable way how to keep track on all issue since it has the tendency to grow number of unread messages to numbers over thousand...

Also please excuse me if I don't respond to your email, my INBOX is really a mess and if you are not lucky, you might get stuck with other unread emails. So pretty please use new [issue tracker](https://github.com/oerdnj/deb.sury.org/issues).

## Documentation

The available documentation related to the packages and PPAs is hosted in the [Wiki](https://github.com/oerdnj/deb.sury.org/wiki).  Everybody can contribute, so if you want to write more documentations on the PHP packages, you are certainly welcome to do so.

## Donate

The PHP packaging is time consuming and I do this mostly in my free time.  Please consider donating if you find the PHP packages useful for your projects.  It also warms a heart to know that this project is useful.
